 2 tbsp potato starch 
 2 pinch of salt
 150cc Iced water

  13. (Crispy tempura batter) 
     Put the mayonnaise into a bowl. Pour it slightly with iced water. Then add salt,  flour and potato starch. Mix everything together with chopsticks quickly. Don't mix too much.

  14. Heat the oil to 340F to 35OF. ( To make it nice flavour, I add 30 % sesami oil into canola oil)
 15. Set aside only flour then shift it to all ingredients. After that, dipping into Tempura batter. 
 16. Deep fry from hard ingredients. ( Temperature  of oil normally increases little by little.) To keeping right temperature, sometimes I turn off the power.  Frying time / Carrot, eggplant (2min). Asparagus(1.5min). in the video, no asparagas...   Shishotou(40 sec). Mushroom(1.5 min). Prawn and squid (1.5-2 min)
