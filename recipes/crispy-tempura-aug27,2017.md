10×10cm komb
200ml water
50ml less sodium soy sauce
50ml mirin
Katuobushi 10g

【Tempura batter】
3/4 cup cake flour
2 tbsp potato starch
2 pinch of salt
150cc Iced water
1 tbsp Japanese mayonnaise
＊I totally forgot to measure the water in the video! You can also make it by freehand.. It's better to make it not too thick and not too thin.

Add 30% sesame oil to Canola oil.

Cook start!

1.  Cut off the roots of asparagus.
2.  Cut carrot into slices.

4.  Cut off the stems of shishitou and make incisions.
5.  Take off the Shiitake mushroom's stems.
6.  Cut the lime for topping
    7.Grated daikon radish and take off most of the moisture part.
7.  Cut the squid into pieces.
8.  Peel off the shell of the prawn. Remove black liquid in the tail and remove back of black vein. Cut the underside of the prawn bit and stretch it in the reverse direction not to be rolled up.
9.  Cut the squid into pieces.
10. After preparing all ingredients, take off the moisture of all ingredients finished with paper towel and leave it dry.

11. (Dipping Sauce)
    Put the komb into the water and heat until before completely boiling. Then, remove comb. After that, add all the ingredients of the sauce into the water and boil it again. And remove Katsuobushi.

12. (Crispy tempura batter)
    Put the mayonnaise into a bowl. Pour it slightly with iced water. Then add salt, flour and potato starch. Mix everything together with chopsticks quickly. Don't mix too much.

13. Heat the oil to 340F to 35OF. ( To make it nice flavour, I add 30 % sesami oil into canola oil)
14. Set aside only flour then shift it to all ingredients. After that, dipping into Tempura batter.
15. Deep fry from hard ingredients. ( Temperature of oil normally increases little by little.) To keeping right temperature, sometimes I turn off the power. Frying time / Carrot, eggplant (2min). Asparagus(1.5min). in the video, no asparagas... Shishotou(40 sec). Mushroom(1.5 min). Prawn and squid (1.5-2 min)
16. Let's serve on a dish!
